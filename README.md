## WHAT IS REFEMI ?
Refemi is a **collaborative plateform** for feminist references.
Its main goal is to **make accessible feminist resources** from anywhere in the world, of any type (books, podcasts, artists, associations, etc) regardless of the feminist movement they belong to.
Our role is to provide a plateform where people can research for their own knowledge, out of curiosity, or for academic purposes. 

## MODERATION PROCESS
Anybody who creates an account has the possibility to suggest a new reference that will be submitted to moderation before its publication.
**We are not affiliated to any political and/or feminist movement**, and the moderation process is there only to ensure the quality of the plateform's content.

## WHO ARE WE ?
As of today, the team includes: 
- Margaux (Instigator of the original idea, product owner and moderator)
- Laura (Fullstack developer and project manager)
- Andy (Fullstack developer)
- Emran (Back-end developer)
